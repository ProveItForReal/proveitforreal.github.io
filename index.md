## Motivation

Science has revolutionized the way humanity creates and validates
knowledge, but these innovations are not widely used by consumers to
make purchasing decisions.

We believe the reason is a lack of trust.

The scientific method as currently imagined places implicit trust in
the scientists performing the experiment. As history has shown, this
can be a disasterous assumption when those scientists are in a
position of moral hazard.

So we're creating a system to fix this. And at the same time we're
fixing other major issues with the current scientific
method. Publication bias, {other biases}.

We hope that by providing a way to perform high quality science in an
untrusted manner, we can revolutionize the way highly contested truths
are estabilshed.

## Plan

Our current plan is to start by improving product studies. Product
studies are the public's most frequent interaction with science. By
tolerating (or worse, expecting) shoddy science in commerce, we are
undermining the public's perception of science as a whole.

We believe we can change how startups perform their studies
immediately, and use that success to progressively expand.

To accomplish this goal, we are creating a webapp to acts as a high
quality (though less flexible) alternative to a Contract Research
Organization. Because it is fully automated, the cost of doing these
less flexible studies will approach the cost of the raw product to be
tested.

With the cost low, and the quality high, such a system might become
the startup equivalent of [citation
needed](http://xkcd.com/285/). Once we have a significant number of
startups using the system, and as we add support for more experiment
types, we will hopefully attract progressively larger corporations.
