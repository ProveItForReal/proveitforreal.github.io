# Vision

The scientific method implicitly trusts experimentors. For many
subjects this is a fine assumption, but for morally hazardous and
politicized topics, this assumption leaves science broken.

We are building a suite of tools that will allow experiment designs to
be defined and debated in advance, and the data to be collected and
analyzed automatically. Use of this protocol will directly address the
most common methological errors in science today, and pave the way for
evidence based products.

# Current Goals

* Design a general, minimal, highly rigorous protocol for product studies.
* Implement this protocol in an open source webapp.
* Proctor this protocol for use by startups seeking to make health claims.

# How You Can Help

* Join the discussion
* Help with protocol design
* Clarify the specifications
